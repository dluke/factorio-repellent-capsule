# Main Feature
A compliment to the poison and slowdown capsules unlocked at military 3 that will make biters flee from the player for a short time.

Higher evolutions may shrug off the effects one or more times before they succumb to the chemical.

# Hidden features
If creating a new world, you can select whether a small pack of capsules and grenades will have survived the crash.

# Changelog
v0.1.2 - Fixed error message that may appear when loading an old save that does not have a crash-site.
